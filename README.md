# Instagram Followers' Reading Preferences and Social Network Project

## Description
This repository contains an Rpubs document showcasing advanced data analysis and visualization skills.

## Project 1: Instagram Followers' Reading Preferences and Social Network Project
- **Objective**: Analyze my Instagram followers' top 10 books from last year and if shared reading preferences influence their social circle/who they follow and any trends in the books they’ve read.
- **Tools Used**: RStudio, Numbers (mac)
- **Key Insights**: These plots and measures give an insight into the dynamics of my Instagram network, focusing on shared reading preferences among my followers and their social connections/followings. I found that within this network, a majority of accounts don’t reciprocate follows, shown by the degrees. By analyzing the network using measures like degree and betweenness, I found key nodes that act are important within the network, suggesting their influence in the network. The exploration of K-step reach shows the reachability of nodes within the network, with a lot of the nodes closer to 1 indicating strong connectivity due to shared book preferences.The reciprocity scores show that there’s a good chance that if an account is following another account, that other account is following them back and that there’s a prominent presence of only one direction edges. The clustering coefficient suggests that there are very few of the possible triplets in the graph that are actually closed. Overall there’s a low density of close knit communities or accounts following each other. Also, the visualization of the network helps find isolated nodes, while also highlighting the importance of other nodes. Overall, my findings shed light on how shared interests; such as reading preferences, impact social connections within your Instagram network, offering valuable insights into community dynamics and interactions, and finding trends in the most listed books. Since there were 100 accounts and over 500 books listed, it is highly likely that there were a lot of connections between accounts. Looking further into the accounts that had the most same books; who accounts follow doesn’t impact their favorite books as much as I initially thought.
